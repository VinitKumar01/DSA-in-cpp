// selection sort -> find the minimum element in array then place it in front sequencely
// Eg. [10, 2, 23, 1, 9, 7]
// Step 1: find the minimum element and swap its position with 0th index. [1, 2, 23, 10, 9, 7]
// Step 2: find the next minimum element and swap its position with 1st index. [1, 2, 23, 10, 9, 7] no effect here
// Step 3: find the next minimum element and swap its position with 2nd index. [1, 2, 7, 10, 9, 23]
// Step 4: find the next minimum element and swap its position with 3rd index. [1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 23]
// Step 5: find the next minimum element and swap its position with 4th index. [1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 23] no effect here
// No need to run it for last element as if the previous elements are sorted it will be sortes automatically.
// Observations -> Elements 6, Steps 5
